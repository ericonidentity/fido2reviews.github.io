bit of technology.

Along with that, it has a notch in the corner, but it\u2019s not a typical location that an ID badge would be attached to a lanyard. The size also is not wide enough to accommodate the typical button-snap plastic loop of a badge holder; it\u2019s designed for a smaller metal lanyard clip. While the AuthenTrend website shows some conceptual pictures of it hanging horizontal or vertical like a badge, it also will not easily fit within a plastic sleeve due to the width; you also need to be able to access the slide-out USB-A connector to charge and/or use the card.</p> <p>With all of this, the card just feels a bit odd. The USB connector that extends from the side of it causes it to sag when inserted into a horizontal USB port; it seems having something like this hanging off the side of a laptop could be an easy breaking point. With all the technology packed into this card, I\u2019m surprised it feels as light as it does in construction. There are multiple LED lights embedded into the card, which will light up and flash in different patterns depending on what you are doing with the card.

On the other side of the demo unit, there is an example print of an ID badge, showing organizations that this has a lot of potential flexibility. Physically the card feels exactly as one would expect and it has the same flexibility and feel as your typical plastic credit card.

Native in Windows, the card never was recognized as having a fingerprint reader, so when going into the security key options, there is nothing available for fingerprint management.

Note that Feitian has three similar looking apps in the Apple App Store for managing fingerprints, but only one works with this card, which is here, Fingerprint Card Manager on the App Store (apple.com).
